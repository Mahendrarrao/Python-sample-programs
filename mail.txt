Looking at ANAP logs for La Negre nx 1483322 - At 26/05 21:33 GMT, POP started receiving ipsec packets suddenly and the ipsec tunnel came up without any changes on ANAP.
This seems to be some sort of NAT issue with customer firewall for hybrid mode anap which got resolved after a while.

The other 2 sites could probably also be the same issue - So please debug natting on the firewall before making any changes or rebooting ANAP.


Thanks,
Syed

Initially 3 sites were down. NX 1483322 came up by itself after ~1 day. 
We do not have contact with customer so not sure if they made any changes on their end however looks like the ANAP has been up since >2days (so no reboot)
 
<aryaka@anap:CLLNE ~> uptime
07:56:01 up 2 days,  5:45,  2 users,  load average: 2.00, 2.00, 2.00
 
ANAP looks to have rebooted with correct version in ~26 seconds around 2018/05/26 02:10:00 itself
Logs form the ANAP @ https://xfer.aryaka.info/xfer/devaansh/Albemarle/ 
Request you to take a look once

Waiting for the customer to come back with the specifics.  
They stated that they will get back by Tuesday as it is a long weekend in the US.  
 
Thanks

Looks like ipsec is down from 26th since the upgrade for these 2 sites. 
No ipsec packets seen from ANAP to POP.
Were you able to check with the customer whether the ANAP is online?
 
 
Thanks,
Syed

[Adding ANAP Engineering for their inputs]
 
Sites that are down currently-  1483101 and 1478799
These went down when the customer was upgraded from 1.8.2.8 to 1.8.2.9
 
ESC-1041 created to track this issue.  We will transfer the logs and update the location in the ticket

Hi Team,
 
On checking the logs for nexus – 1483101 Santiago - https://eagleeye.aryaka.info/#nx_1483101.info
We do see ANAP taking the config file for 1.8.2.9 and rebooting after that. But once ANAP comes online after reboot it rolls back to 1.8.2.8.

Hello Mayur,
 
According to the tracker , I see Cavotec Nova Milanese site faced the same issue after its upgrade. But , the insertion was ASRV-SRM .
 
Thanks,

Hybrid mode and with checkpoint involved - there is no ssh access to the Anap in this case. I believe the customer hasn’t allowed the same.
 
We had a similar issue with another customer during the upgrade.  Was it JAS?  And was that site in hybrid mode too? 
Can we check the confluence tracker for details please 
 
If yes, we need to understand the issue in detail and stop all hybrid insertion upgrades if needed. 
 
Thanks 
Mayur Patwary

Hello Team,
 
While upgrading Albemarle to 1.8.2.9 , we encountered ANAP upgrade to be failed at the following sites : 
 
Santiago
La Negra
Somerset,NJ 
 
The nexuses are upgraded to FOF. 
 
 
 
The tunnels are down at these sites currently with no pronap connectivity . 
Tried manual push from APAN(push nap software command) but it did not work.

We have reached out to customer and dropped a mail as well to let us know of any local contact available currently for the manual reboot of ANAPs.
 
Thanks,
Prerna
